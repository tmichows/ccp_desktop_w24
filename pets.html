            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>

            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width="400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three
                different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as
                long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not
                wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his
                toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <img src="images/Fitz.jpeg" width="400" alt="Boston terrier watching a tennis ball at the table.">

            <p>Loves chasings tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. Often found sitting by the fire in
                wintertime, and in sun patches when available. He’s energetic, mischievous, and easily bored. He
                loves
                people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long.
            </p>
            <p>Loves barking up trees, running around on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He
                especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn’t get a snack.

            <h2>Juno</h2>

            <img src="images/classic_juno.JPG" width="400" alt="Black and brown dog asleep on his side">

            <p>No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the more special. He was adopted
                before
                he was one year old; despite this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the same
                size,
                hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten years old, Juno is dealing with
                hip
                problems, but manages to stay in good spirits.
            </p>
            <p>One of Juno’s favorite pastimes is finding the dirtiest puddle within a one-mile radius and making
                sure
                every inch of him makes contact with said puddle. If rolling around in dirt was an Olympic sport,
                Juno
                would have been the one that facilitated its inclusion into the Olympics.

            <h2>Pluto</h2>

            <img src="images/pluto.jpg" width="400" alt="White dog looking up.">

            <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to
                the
                Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
                personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the
                window to
                keep watch of his house. Don’t let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the
                mailman and squirrels every single day.
            </p>
            <p>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Pluto’s favorite part of the
                day is
                his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his
                toy
                duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get some
                practice with his toy duck.

            <p>
                Sprout, a shy and elusive kitten when he first arrived at four months old, gradually became an
                affectionate companion. He enjoyed sleeping on my bed, but his early morning wake-up calls at 6:30 AM
                were a daily routine.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my challenging academic phase, Sprout became my constant companion during late-night drawing
                sessions, quietly curling up on my lap, providing comfort and banishing solitude.
