            <p>Welcome to Tim's index page for his SI 539 Common Class Project, your go-to destination for all things
                pets, recipes, travel, and LEGO Star Wars!

            <p>
                Please note that despite my best efforts, I could not get aXe to not give serious issues with the
                YouTube videos. aXe is specifically angry at the channel icons, but nothing online seems to be able to
                help or explain where I can give alt-text for the channel icons(I assume that's why aXe is yelling). I
                believe it is a CSS issue well beyond the scope of this assignment. They have become images that link
                you to the video upon clicking
                instead. The old code remains as a comment.

                YouTube's embed copyable code also seems outdated as per w3's validator and not up to date with what
                little I could gain about what WCAG wants.

                The Image and Photo Gallery's order is:

            <p> I originally did not have this set as a kid. I can clearly remmeber seeing it on display at Toysrus
                before I really got into STAR WARS.
                Once I got into Star Wars, this became the set on the front of my mind for two reasons: the Kaskyyyk
                trooper and the Turbo Tank itself.
            </p>

            <p> I received the set new in-box for my High School graduation for the cool price of $300. It was worth it.
                It certainly is nowhere near the build quality of newer sets, but I prefer when LEGO sets feel more like
                toys instead of display items.

                <p> This was my first large set. It launched along with a new Star Wars TV show: The Clone Wars. Which
                    if
                    you haven't watched, you should... just so Episode III can go from wtf this is so sad to screaming
                    and
                    crying at the screen watching the clones commit Order 66.

                </p>

                <p> This is my most customized set ever. It became so customized that it broke several times because who
                    needs structural integrity. This was also one of the few sets I held onto after selling my
                    collection.
                    Selling my collection is up there as one of the worst mistakes of my life.

                <p> During the first wave of Clone Wars sets, these guys were hard to come by. I had five because I had
                    all five sets they came in. Next year, they released a battlepack and they became very common. </p>

                <img src="images/75311_alt1.webp" width="500" alt="LEGO set of Imperial Armored Marauder">

                <ul>
                    <li>Name: Imperial Armored Marauder</li>
                    <li>Release Year: 2021</li>
                    <li>Set Number: 75311</li>

                    <li>Number of Minifigures: 4</li>
                    <li>Release Price: $40</li>
                    <li> Current Value: $42</li>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p> Now you're probably thinking, this set? Really? As number three. While I can understand that thought
                    process, I think this set stands out among newer LEGO sets for its value, price to part ratio, and
                    the
                    amount of things that can be moved, opened, closed, hitched, etc.
                </p>

                <p> I would normally expect this set to go for anywhere between $45 and $55 in modern LEGO pricing
                    schemes,
                    but it's at a nice $40 and was rarely at that price; It could easily have been had for $32. It also
                    has
                    a very good price to part ratio of $0.08 per part. This ratio is not that useful anymore because of
                    how
                    complex and big pieces have become, but it stands out. The set feels like an excellent toy because
                    there
                    are so many things that can be interacted with. It isn't just a tank you have to make pew-pew noises
                    for; you can load cargo; you can "explode" parts of the set. You can shoot the guns; you can move
                    the AA
                    gun; and you can load minifigures.
                </p>
