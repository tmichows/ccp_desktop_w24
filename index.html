            <h2> Clone Turbo Tank </h2>
            <img src="images/lsw_ctt.png" width="500" alt="LEGO set of STAR WARS Clone Turbo Tank">

            <ul>
                <li>Name: Clone Turbo Tank (with Light-Up Mace Windu)</li>
                <li>Release Year: 2005</li>
                <li>Set Number: 7261-1(2)</li>
                <li>Number of Parts: 771</li>
                <li>Number of Minifigures: 8</li>
                <li>Release Price: $90</li>
                <li> Current Value: $760</li>
            </ul>

            <p> I originally did not have this set as a kid. I can clearly remmeber seeing it on display at Toysrus
                before I really got into STAR WARS.
                Once I got into Star Wars, this became the set on the front of my mind for two reasons: the Kaskyyyk
                trooper and the Turbo Tank itself.
            </p>

            <p> I received the set new in-box for my High School graduation for the cool price of $300. It was worth it.
                It certainly is nowhere near the build quality of newer sets, but I prefer when LEGO sets feel more like
                toys instead of display items.

                <li>Release Year: 2008</li>

            </ul>

            <p> This was my first large set. It launched along with a new Star Wars TV show: The Clone Wars. Which if
                you haven't watched, you should... just so Episode III can go from wtf this is so sad to screaming and
                crying at the screen watching the clones commit Order 66.

            </p>

            <p> This is my most customized set ever. It became so customized that it broke several times because who
                needs structural integrity. This was also one of the few sets I held onto after selling my collection.
                Selling my collection is up there as one of the worst mistakes of my life.

            <p> During the first wave of Clone Wars sets, these guys were hard to come by. I had five because I had
                all five sets they came in. Next year, they released a battlepack and they became very common. </p>

            <h2> Imperial Armored Marauder </h2>
            <img src="images/75311_alt1.webp" width="500" alt="LEGO set of Imperial Armored Marauder">

            <ul>
                <li>Name: Imperial Armored Marauder</li>
                <li>Release Year: 2021</li>
                <li>Set Number: 75311</li>
                <li>Number of Parts: 456</li>
                <li>Number of Minifigures: 4</li>
                <li>Release Price: $40</li>
                <li> Current Value: $42</li>
            </ul>

            <p> Now you're probably thinking, this set? Really? As number three. While I can understand that thought
                process, I think this set stands out among newer LEGO sets for its value, price to part ratio, and the
                amount of things that can be moved, opened, closed, hitched, etc.
            </p>

            <p> I would normally expect this set to go for anywhere between $45 and $55 in modern LEGO pricing schemes,
                but it's at a nice $40 and was rarely at that price; It could easily have been had for $32. It also has
                a very good price to part ratio of $0.08 per part. This ratio is not that useful anymore because of how
                complex and big pieces have become, but it stands out. The set feels like an excellent toy because there
                are so many things that can be interacted with. It isn't just a tank you have to make pew-pew noises
                for; you can load cargo; you can "explode" parts of the set. You can shoot the guns; you can move the AA
                gun; and you can load minifigures.
            </p>
